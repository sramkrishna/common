# CI tooling

> **Split notice (2026-06-24):** Incident-log / gotcha entries moved to [`ci-pitfalls.md`](../ci-pitfalls/SKILL.md). Shell script authoring and testability patterns moved to [`shell-scripts.md`](../shell-scripts/SKILL.md). This file retains CI policy and configuration.

## When to Use

- Editing `.github/workflows/` or `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Debugging pre-commit failures around floating tags, auto-fix hooks, or schema validation
- Updating shared CI policy that propagates across factory repos
- Auditing whether a workflow change belongs in repo-local CI or `projectbluefin/actions`

## When NOT to Use

- Debugging a silent CI failure or `startup_failure` with no output → [`ci-pitfalls.md`](../ci-pitfalls/SKILL.md)
- Writing or testing shell scripts under `system_files/` → [`shell-scripts.md`](../shell-scripts/SKILL.md)
- User-facing image content changes in `system_files/` or `Containerfile`
- Release promotion logic and stream semantics (use `release-promotion.md`)
- Issue lifecycle or queue automation (use `label-workflow.md` or bonedigger skills)
- One-off PR status checks with no reusable CI pattern to capture

---

## Core Process

1. Read the workflow or pre-commit hook before describing it; do not rely on memory.
2. Classify the ref or tool involved: external action, internal `projectbluefin/*` reusable, schema validator, or local hook.
3. For workflow steps that call repo-local entrypoints such as `just check`, read the full dependency chain and install every clean-runner dependency in that workflow before the step.
4. Keep `just check` hermetic. A check that reaches a third-party host belongs in its own workflow with a path filter and a cron, not in the repo-wide gate — otherwise someone else's outage reddens every open PR and the merge queue, and offline contributors cannot commit. Enforce this over the whole recipe **closure** — header, body, and every recipe `check` depends on — not the header line alone; `tests/test_chairlift_config.py::test_just_check_stays_hermetic` does this and carries mutation tests proving it. Keep workflow/job permissions minimal (`contents: read` unless more is required); GitHub Actions supports step-level `env` and workflow/job `permissions`, source: `/websites/github_en_actions`. **Every workflow declares a top-level `permissions:` block.** Use `permissions: {}` when each job already declares its own scopes, so a future job added without a block gets an empty token instead of silently inheriting the repository default. A job-level block alone does not cover that: the top-level nil default is what a new job inherits.
5. Apply the policy in this order: artifact-protecting CI gates first, agent-enforced process conventions second.
6. Run the lightest verification that matches the change (`pre-commit`, `actionlint`, or direct source inspection).
7. If the session uncovered a non-obvious CI trap, write it to [`ci-pitfalls.md`](../ci-pitfalls/SKILL.md) in the same change. If it's a shell authoring/testability pattern, write it to [`shell-scripts.md`](../shell-scripts/SKILL.md).

## SHA pinning policy

**All third-party `uses:` references must be pinned to a full commit SHA with a version comment.** Floating tags (`@v4`, `@main`, `@latest`) are rejected by the pre-commit hook.

```yaml
# correct — full SHA + human-readable version comment
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4

# rejected by pre-commit
uses: actions/checkout@v4
uses: actions/checkout@main
```

**Internal `projectbluefin/` refs use managed floating tags (`@main` or `@v1`), not SHA pins.** The `no-floating-action-tags` hook exempts all `projectbluefin/` refs. See [sha-pinning.md](references/sha-pinning.md) for the full policy and Floating-tag guard details.

---

## Pre-commit conventions

- Auto-fix hooks **modify files and abort the commit**. Re-stage changed files and rerun before retrying.
- AI-authored commits should carry both trailers (`Assisted-by:` + `Co-authored-by: Copilot`) — convention only, not a CI gate.
- `.github/release-state.yaml` is validated with `check-jsonschema` against the pinned schema in `projectbluefin/actions`.

See [pre-commit-conventions.md](references/pre-commit-conventions.md) for the full auto-fix loop, AI attribution, schema validation, Skill drift detection, and Docs hygiene hooks.

---

## Docs hygiene pre-commit checks

The repo-level `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes local hooks that protect the agent docs structure:

| Hook | Script | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `Validate skill front-matter` | `scripts/check-skill-frontmatter.sh` | Every `docs/skills/*.md` has required front-matter keys and description ≤256 chars. |
| `Validate docs/SKILL.md skill index` | `scripts/check-skill-index.sh` | `docs/SKILL.md` links to every skill file in `docs/skills/`. |
| `Validate internal markdown links` | `scripts/check-doc-links.sh` | Every relative `.md` link in `docs/` resolves to an existing file. |

These are **hygiene gates**, not blocking CI workflow gates. The front-matter size budget is soft at 200 lines and hard at 500 lines; oversized legacy skills are a burn-down list — migrate them to the per-skill directory layout on sight.

---

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "pre-commit fixed it, so the commit probably succeeded." | Auto-fix hooks modify files **and fail the run**; re-stage the files and rerun the hooks. |
| "The regex already exempts `projectbluefin/actions`; subpaths will work too." | Reusable workflows add `/.github/workflows/...` before `@`; without an optional subpath, pygrep rules can still flag them. |
| "This is only a process convention, so CI details are not worth documenting." | Factory CI policy is shared infrastructure; undocumented traps get rediscovered across multiple repos. |
| "I know what this workflow publishes." | Read the workflow file. Project-internal CI facts drift faster than model memory. |

## Red Flags

- A commit fails with `Files were modified by this hook` and you retry without `git add`-ing the changed files
- A local floating-tag hook suddenly starts flagging internal reusable workflow refs
- A doc about CI policy describes current workflow behavior without quoting or deriving it from source
- A silent `startup_failure` is attributed to "GitHub being flaky" without checking caller `permissions:` or branch-from-target → see [`ci-pitfalls.md`](../ci-pitfalls/SKILL.md)

## Verification

- [ ] Read the workflow or hook being documented, not a secondary doc
- [ ] If pre-commit modified files, review the diff and re-stage them before retrying
- [ ] For `.github/workflows/` changes, run `pre-commit run --all-files` and `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
- [ ] For doc-only CI skill updates, verify the examples and regexes against the current repo files they describe
- [ ] If a named tool's behavior matters (for example `pre-commit`, `trivy`, `shellcheck`), verify it against Context7 and record the library ID in frontmatter
- [ ] If the trap belongs in the incident log, put it in [`ci-pitfalls.md`](../ci-pitfalls/SKILL.md), not here
- [ ] If the pattern is about shell authoring or testability, put it in [`shell-scripts.md`](../shell-scripts/SKILL.md), not here
