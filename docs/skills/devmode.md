# devmode — Turn on Developer Mode

## When to Use

- Updating docs or UX around Bluefin Developer Mode
- Verifying the canonical user-facing command for developer setup
- Checking what the devmode wizard installs and how it behaves
- Auditing legacy `-dx` references or stale rebase guidance

## When NOT to Use

- Writing Dakota-specific overrides — Dakota should fall through to common unless there is a real Dakota-only need
- Documenting `ujust toggle-devmode` as the primary user-facing command
- Recommending `rpm-ostree install` as a fallback for Developer Mode tooling
- Describing any Developer Mode flow as a rebase to a `-dx` image

## What this is

`ujust devmode` is a local setup wizard that installs a developer stack on any Bluefin image in-place. **There is no -dx image rebase.** The -dx image variant is retired.

File: `system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/just/system.just`

`ujust toggle-devmode` is a legacy compatibility name. Docs and UX should point users to `ujust devmode`.

## Three-Tier Developer Model

Bluefin's developer story aligns into three tiers:

- **Tier 1 — Podman Desktop (Docker-compatible, familiar UX)**: Default recommendation for container workflows. Familiar Docker daemon UX with zero VM tax.
- **Tier 2 — distrobox (standalone recipes)**: Linux-native power user path for CLI tools and mutable environments. Not surfaced in the main devmode onboarding flow.
- **Tier 3 — Lima Ubuntu VM (WSL/container machine equivalent)**: Lightweight Linux VM for developers coming from macOS or Windows who expect a persistent Linux machine, `$HOME` mounted writable, and VS Code wired up out of the box with zero manual configuration.

### How Lima Stacks with Devcontainers

Lima provides the machine layer, while Devcontainers provide the project layer:

```
Host (Bluefin, immutable)
  └── Lima Ubuntu VM        <- persistent machine via KVM, $HOME mounted writable
        └── devcontainer    <- project-scoped container inside the VM
              └── code
```

This replicates the Windows WSL2 + Dev Containers workflow:
1. VS Code connects to `lima-ubuntu` via the Remote - SSH extension.
2. VS Code detects `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and prompts "Reopen in Container".
3. Containers run inside the Lima VM with full IntelliSense, debugging, and terminal access.

## What it installs

### Always
- `devcontainer` CLI (brew) — central to the dx workflow for all editors

### User-selectable (single `gum choose --no-limit` screen)

| Section | Item | What it installs |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | Docker | docker + docker-compose + lazydocker + dive |
| Virtualization | Podman Desktop | flatpak `io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop` |
| Virtualization | Lima | brew install lima + `setup-lima` automated setup |
| IDE | VS Code | `ublue-os/tap/visual-studio-code-linux` |
| IDE | VSCodium | `ublue-os/tap/vscodium-linux` |
| IDE | Antigravity | `ublue-os/tap/antigravity-linux` |
| IDE | Zed | `ublue-os/tap/zed-linux` |
| IDE | JetBrains Toolbox | `ublue-os/tap/jetbrains-toolbox-linux` |
| CLI Editors | Neovim | brew nvim |
| CLI Editors | Helix | brew helix |
| CLI Editors | vim | brew vim |
| CLI Editors | micro | brew micro |

Docker and Podman Desktop are **pre-selected** by default.
`virt-manager` (`ujust setup-vms`) and `incus` (`ujust setup-incus`) are demoted to standalone recipes.

---

## UX flow

```
Title box
  → gum choose --no-limit  (single screen, section headers)
  → summary box (what will be installed)
  → "Install now?" confirm
  → gum spin progress per package
  → pkexec group setup (conditional on selection)
  → setup-lima execution (if Lima selected)
  → marker file written to ~/.config/bluefin/devmode
  → done box
```

Re-running when marker exists shows "already configured, add more tools?" prompt.

---

## Groups

Groups are added via `pkexec` at the end, conditional on what was selected:

| Package | Group added |
|---|---|
| Docker | `docker` |
| Lima | `kvm` (handled via KVM preflight in `setup-lima`) |
| Always | `dialout` |

Standalone recipes handle their own groups:
- `setup-incus` adds `incus-admin`
- `setup-vms` configures the libvirt user session

`dx-group` remains as a standalone recipe for manual use.

---

## Lima Setup Details (`ujust setup-lima`)

`ujust setup-lima` provides zero-config WSL equivalent machine setup:
1. **KVM preflight**: checks `/dev/kvm` access, adds the user to the `kvm` group via `pkexec` if needed, and prompts for a reboot if group membership changed.
2. **Package install**: installs `lima` via Homebrew (pulling `qemu` automatically).
3. **SSH config wiring**: prepends `Include ~/.lima/*/ssh.config` to `~/.ssh/config` before any `Host *` or `Match` blocks, ensuring `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` and `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`.
4. **Instance creation**: launches `limactl start --name ubuntu --mount-writable --tty=false template:ubuntu-lts` (warning user about ~600MB initial cloud image download).
5. **Persistence**: enables systemd autostart across reboots via `limactl autostart enable ubuntu`.
6. **Health check**: verifies SSH connectivity with `limactl shell ubuntu true`.
7. **Connection instructions**: prints VS Code Remote SSH connection guidance.

## Tap strategy

- `ublue-os/tap` — tapped once if any of VS Code / VSCodium / Antigravity / JetBrains selected
- `ublue-os/experimental-tap` — tapped once if Zed selected

## VS Code defaults

- Keep VS Code extensions in `system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/ide.Brewfile` using `vscode "publisher.extension"` entries instead of a post-install shell hook.
- The only VS Code config we ship in the image is the default `settings.json` at `system_files/bluefin/etc/skel/.config/Code/User/settings.json`.

---

## State tracking

- Marker: `~/.config/bluefin/devmode`
- Touch on completion, checked on re-entry
- No full uninstall path — individual `ujust toggle-vms`, `brew uninstall`, etc.

---

## Legacy -dx image users

If `IMAGE_NAME` ends in `dx`, the wizard shows an advisory:
> "Legacy -dx image detected. After setup, run 'bootc switch ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:stable' to switch to the standard image."

The wizard still runs normally — it does NOT rebase automatically.

---

## `install-system-flatpaks` fix

The old `image-flavor =~ dx` gate was removed. That gate was dead once the -dx image retired — it would silently skip all dev flatpaks forever. The recipe now installs `system-flatpaks.Brewfile` only (no dx split).

---

## Known caveats

- **Docker daemon**: `brew install docker` provides the CLI. The `moby-engine` daemon must be present in the base image as a layered system package. If `dockerd` is missing, docker CLI works but containers won't run. Verify moby is in the Containerfile before shipping.
- **Lima guest runtime**: Lima uses `containerd`/`nerdctl` by default. For devcontainer workflows requiring the Docker daemon, Docker can be installed inside the Lima guest VM (`limactl shell ubuntu sudo apt-get install docker.io`).
- **incus & virt-manager**: Demoted to standalone ujust recipes (`ujust setup-vms`, `ujust setup-incus`).
- **`gum choose --no-limit` section headers**: header strings (e.g. `── Docker ───`) are selectable items. They are filtered out in the summary/install logic by using specific `grep -q` patterns that don't match header text. Do not use item names that are substrings of header text.

---

## Core Process

1. Treat `ujust devmode` as the canonical entrypoint; only mention `toggle-devmode` as legacy compatibility context.
2. Verify the current implementation in `system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/just/system.just` before documenting behavior.
3. Describe Developer Mode as an in-place setup flow: `ujust devmode` opens the gum wizard.
4. Document optional tools exactly as the wizard presents them (Podman Desktop and Lima in Virtualization).
5. For virt-manager and incus, document them as standalone recipes (`ujust setup-vms`, `ujust setup-incus`).
6. If touching downstream overrides, prefer removing stale overrides so common's implementation remains the source of truth.

## Common Rationalizations

- **"`toggle-devmode` is still there, so docs can recommend it."**
  No. It is a compatibility name, not the canonical UX.
- **"If brew fails we should tell users to layer packages."**
  No. Bluefin docs should not recommend `rpm-ostree install` as the escape hatch here.
- **"Developer Mode means rebasing to a special image."**
  No. The `-dx` image path is retired.

## Red Flags

- Docs that tell users to run `ujust toggle-devmode`
- Surfacing `virt-manager` or `incus` inside the primary devmode wizard
- Any `rpm-ostree install` fallback
- Any suggestion that Developer Mode rebases to a `-dx` image
- Dakota-specific docs or overrides that assume `dakota-dx` exists

## Verification

- [ ] User-facing docs recommend `ujust devmode`, not `ujust toggle-devmode`
- [ ] devmode wizard collapses Virtualization to Podman Desktop and Lima
- [ ] `setup-lima` provides automated, zero-config Ubuntu LTS VM setup
- [ ] virt-manager and incus are standalone recipes (`setup-vms`, `setup-incus`)
- [ ] No docs recommend `rpm-ostree install` for Developer Mode tooling
- [ ] Bluefin Developer Mode is described as in-place setup, not image rebasing
- [ ] Any downstream override still matches common's current implementation or is removed
